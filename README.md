thisisaaronland-poetry-userscript
=================================

@thisisaaronland writes tweets to be poetry. Read them that way.

e.g., https://twitter.com/thisisaaronland/status/228939505560875008

Change:

    @alexandrak but it don't make no difference / 'cause I ain't gonna be easy easy / the only time I'm easy's when I'm / killed by desk

to

    @alexandrak but it don't make no difference
    'cause I ain't gonna be easy easy
    the only time I'm easy's when I'm
    killed by desk

without affecting links, hashtags, and so on.

## How?

Load the raw file, in a browser which can run userscripts.

Chrome doesn't allow userscripts to be loaded from wherever, so, you may require TamperMonkey.

## Why?

I don't know.
