=================================

@thisisaaronland writes tweets to be poetry. Read them that way.

e.g., for https://twitter.com/thisisaaronland/status/258392428090884097 , change:

> guns don't kill people / single moms in binders kill people apparently

to

> guns don't kill people  
> single moms in binders kill people apparently  

Without affecting shortened links, usernames, hashtags, and so on.

## How?

Use a browser which can run userscripts. Chrome doesn't allow userscripts to be loaded from wherever, so, you may require the TamperMonkey extension. On Firefox, use the Greasemonkey extension.

In this browser, load the JavaScript file:

## Why?

I don't know.
