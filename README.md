=================================

@thisisaaronland writes tweets to be poetry. Read them that way.

e.g., https://twitter.com/thisisaaronland/status/228939505560875008

Change:

    @alexandrak but it don't make no difference / 'cause I ain't gonna be easy easy / the only time I'm easy's when I'm / killed by desk

to

    @alexandrak but it don't make no difference
    'cause I ain't gonna be easy easy
    the only time I'm easy's when I'm
    killed by desk

without affecting links, hashtags, and so on.

## How?

Use a browser which can run userscripts. Chrome doesn't allow userscripts to be loaded from wherever, so, you may require the TamperMonkey extension. On Firefox, use the Greasemonkey extension.

In this browser, load the JavaScript file:

## Why?

I don't know.
